### **Intro**

We are interested in advanced workflow for `Revise.jl` for data analytic workflows, in a console and script environment. 

The package [`Revise.jl`](https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/#Installation-1) is used for loading packages while developing the packages, avoiding the JIT recompilation process for the module. 

To use this, means that we need to use the package development process in Julia.
