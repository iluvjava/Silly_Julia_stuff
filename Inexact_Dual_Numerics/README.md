### **Intro**

We wish to applish the task of modeling error with the scientific notation system. 

**Objectives**: 

* Our objective is to capture the propagation of floating errors
* Or just inexact numbers for engineers and statistcians. 

Machine Epsilon for Float64 is $2^{-54}$

These errors are intrinsic, carried by multiplication. We need to monitor the hehavior of floating points down to binary level to track the propagation of the error during its computations.
