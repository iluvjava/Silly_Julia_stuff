### **Intro**

This part is getting pretty meta, not suited for a notebook environment. We are going to use the Pkg package managers and learn how to use it. 

A majority stuff will be referenced from [here](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1.2/environments/). 



### **Basics**
To enter the package managing mode in REPL use `]` on the prompt. 

```
activate 
```
This command activates the venv at the current work directory. `pwd()` brings up the directory in julia.
